"""Anonymize a directory of downloaded Zoom interview folders.

Each folder under the input path is one participant, and the folder's name is
that participant's ID. For every folder this writes a matching folder under the
output path: media copied verbatim, transcripts rewritten with speaker names
replaced.

Every decision is made from one folder's own transcripts. Nothing is inferred by
comparing folders to each other, so a folder anonymizes the same way whether it
is run alone or alongside fifty others.

Within a folder, speakers are labeled by the order they first speak, which makes
the result predictable rather than clever:

    first speaker   -> interviewer 1
    second speaker  -> the participant ID
    third onwards   -> interviewer 2, interviewer 3, ...

When that ordering is wrong -- the participant spoke first, or a colleague joined
before the participant did -- name the interviewers with ``--interviewer``. Those
are treated as interviewers wherever they fall, in every folder, and the
participant becomes the first remaining speaker.

The names to replace come only from speaker labels. Nothing else is treated as a
name, so places, employers, and products are left exactly as they are; this pass
is a first sweep over transcripts you are going to read anyway, not a substitute
for reading them.

Chat logs, transcript backups, and file types it does not recognize are skipped
rather than copied on the assumption they are harmless. Anything it could not
resolve is printed under REVIEW.

Usage:
    python scripts/anonymize_zoom.py INPUT_DIR OUTPUT_DIR --dry-run
    python scripts/anonymize_zoom.py INPUT_DIR OUTPUT_DIR
    python scripts/anonymize_zoom.py INPUT_DIR OUTPUT_DIR --interviewer "Ada Lovelace"
