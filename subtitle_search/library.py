"""Working across a whole set of recordings.

The reader is built around one session. Thematic analysis is not: it needs every
quote in the study at once, grouped by what they are about rather than by which
interview they came from. This module flattens the per-recording quote files
into one corpus, and stores the themes built on top of it.

Themes live in ``library.themes.json`` at the root of the library, beside the
recording folders rather than inside any of them, because a theme belongs to the
study and not to a participant. A theme holds references, never copies: the
quote text stays in the recording's own file, so correcting a transcript still
updates every theme that quote appears in.

The same themes are worked on two ways. The board is columns; the canvas is a
plane, where a theme is a resizable area and a quote is a card sitting somewhere
inside it. So the file records geometry as well as membership: an area's box, and
a position for every card. Membership is *derived* from the cards -- a card
inside an area is a quote in that theme -- because two records of one fact is two
records to get out of step. ``refs`` is kept in sync as the shape the board reads.

A card, not a quote, is the thing on the canvas. That distinction is what lets a
quote sit in two themes at once: two cards, one quote, the way you would
photocopy a post-it to pin it to two walls. Only one card per quote per area,
though, so a slip of the hand cannot quietly stack a quote on top of itself.
